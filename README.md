# [Corda Issue 5254](https://github.com/corda/corda/issues/5254) #

This is a simple, dummy v4.0 Cordapp meant to demonstrate the inability to implement hiearchical persistence
as referenced in the official Corda v4.0 documentation. 

The documentation is unchanged for v4.1.

Please refer to the comments in `contracts/src/main/kotlin/com/template/schema/StoreSchema` for in depth 
analysis of the persistence issue.

Errors can be generated by following the comment directions and using the premade `Run Flow Tests` configuration.
